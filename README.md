Hypermiling

The webpage is available at: https://p-r-b.github.io/Hobby_Page/


Introduction

For my hobby page project, I decided on a theme that interests me, yet one that I have not yet engaged in as I do not own a car.
The text content is presented in a technical manner, as I happened to have studied engineering academically.


Methodology

1. Before dealing with the code, I conceptualised the page content and structure by producing a draft mockup of the page in Microsoft Word. This facilitated my    decision as to how the page should be structured when recreated in code.
   It is here where I typed out the bulk of the text content to use Word's built-in tools to inspect for spelling and/or grammatical errors.
2. Once I was satisfied with the flow of the Word document, I progressed onto the HTML recreation through Visual Studio Code, another Microsoft program.            Introducing the text content was relatively straightforward, as it was copied and pasted from my Word draft (although certain words were tweaked in the 
   code later on).
3. Being content with the flow of the HTML content alone thus far, I created a separate CSS file (again through VS Code) to enhance the visual appeal of the        page. I altered the font style to Arial, just as it was in the Word draft as I believed that the default serif style did not mesh with the hypermiling theme    very well. Moreover, I enlarged the title relative to the rest of the text and added some colour.
4. To facilitate the CSS application, I revisited my HTML script to divide the relevant sections of text into classes. I also added an image to the page and
   credited the source by linking the image directly to it through an <href> attribute.
5. To add a present date functionality, I had to type the JavaScript into the same file as the HTML, as I would not be able to concatenate the date with the        text in the HTML paragraph otherwise. InnerHTML was used for this, and the text was resized by additional code in the CSS file.
6. I extended the page with an additional section, the only one to contain an embedded image. The main struggle was with getting the paragraph text and image      displayed side-by-side, however after considerable trial and error, I settled for the float option to achiever this.
7. I tweaked the presentation by introducing padding so that the bodies of text were well-contained within their respective boxes, rather than extending to the    boundaries.


Operation

The page is intended for reading only (much like a newspaper article) and lacks personalisation.

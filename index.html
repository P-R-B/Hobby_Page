    <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>Hypermiling is the practice of maximising the mileage achieved by automobiles involving 
        (but not limited to) the cumulation of optimising the following variables listed below 
        to maximise fuel economy and minimise mechanical and thermal losses.                     </p>
     <p>Under the adverse current economic circumstances resulting in high interest rates and 
        rising fuel prices, it has become increasingly necessary to explore ways of managing our 
        fuel consumption more efficiently to maximise the cost-effectiveness of private 
        automobile ownership and stem the demand for fuel, enabling for the prices to recover to 
        more affordable levels.                                                                  </p>
     <p>On the other hand, several hypermiling enthusiasts merely partake in the activity for 
        recreational purposes, gamifying the practice into a competition for achieving the 
        highest mileage.                                                                         </p>
     <p>This page focusses on petrol and diesel cars, shying away from the battery-electric type,
        although most of the points discussed on this page relating to drag, weight and rolling
        resistance applies to them too.                                                          </p>

   <div class="Section">
    <h2>Engine</h2>
     <p>An optimum gear ratio for cars tends to be one that favours engine torque over engine 
        speed, as a larger proportion of the combustion pressure moves the car as opposed to 
        being lost internally. However the torque should still be moderated to avoid excessive 
        pressures that could damage the engine. Furthermore, if the engine speed is too low, the 
        thermal losses will be greater as the gases would have insufficient time to expand before 
        the heat escapes through the chamber's metal walls.                                                                        </p>
     <p>It is best practice to lubricate the internal combustion engine using the grades of oil 
        recommended by the manufacturer to minimise frictional losses between the reciprocating 
        pistons and shafts. Whilst thicker oils offer a more protective lubrication layer with a 
        lower rate of deterioration, their higher viscosity renders them less able to seep into 
        smaller crevices, hence providing a smaller surface area of coverage compared to thinner 
        oils.                                                                                    </p>
     <p>To mitigate the development of internal rust and particulate matter, the engine can be 
        occasionally cleaned with ethanol-rich fuel or even pure ethanol. The main drawback is 
        that prolonged use of alcohol may accelerate the corrosion of the engine.                </p>
     <p>It is more economical to use cars for long distance journeys, as this practice allows
        enough time for the engine to gradually heat up to its optimal working temperature range.
        Likewise, use of cars for short trips should be avoided where practicable.               </p>
   </div>

   <div class="Section">
    <h2>Fairing</h2>
     <p>The turbulence of the airflow around the automobile exterior will resist the motion of 
        the car, increasing the brake specific fuel consumption (fuel consumed per unit of power 
        output) of the engine. Consequently, it is best practice to leave all windows shut and 
        not allowing objects such as flags or bicycles to hang externally.                       </p>
     <p>To reduce the drag coefficient, the bodyshells of some cars have been modified with 
        fairings to become more streamlined. An aerodynamic front reduces the form drag, 
        allowing the air to flow around the car exterior more smoothly. An aerodynamic rear 
        delays the separation of the airflow from the car body, reducing the suction effect 
        that results from low pressure behind the car.                                           </p>
   </div>

   <div class="Section">
    <h2> Wheels</h2>
     <p>An adequate tyre pressure should be maintained at all times to minimise the rolling 
        resistance between the wheels and the road.                                              </p>
     <p>The diameter and width of the wheels should be carefully based on the performance
        characteristics of the car.
        The benefits of larger diameter wheels are:
        <ul>
         <li>Lower rolling resistance</li>
         <li>Smoother rides over bumps and potholes</li>
         <li>Steadier speed</li>
         <li>More contact area with the road</li>
        </ul>                                                                                    </p>
     <p>The benefits of smaller diameter wheels are:
        <ul>
         <li>Less mass</li>
         <li>Lower centre of gravity</li>
         <li>More manouverability</li>
         <li>Less drag</li>
        </ul>                                                                                    </p>
     <p>Low profile tyres offer lower rolling resistance, however offer less comfort and less 
        shock-absorbency for the wheels.                                                         </p>
   </div>

   <div class="Section">
    <h2>Weight</h2>
     <p>To minimise the total weight, the car should be rid of all unnecessary items 
        (especially in the boot). Likewise, the amount of fuel stored in the tank should also 
        be reduced to better reflect the amount of fuel you actually require for the particular 
        journey.                                                                                 </p>
     <p>These marginal gains will stack up to make the car lighter, reducing the loads and 
        frictional losses in the bearings, reducing maintenance costs.                           </p>
   </div>

   <div class="Section">
    <h2>Coasting</h2>
     <p>Engines perform optimally under steady-state conditions, therefore it is good practice 
        to maintain a constant speed and avoid sharp accelerations. This is where the momentum 
        of the car can offer a great benefit. When descending down a noticeable gradient, the 
        accelerator can be disengaged so that no fuel is consumed during the descent.            </p>
     <p>As increasing the engine power provides a diminishing return on the achieved speed due 
        to increased drag, hypermilers tend to slightly reduce their speed to greatly reduce 
        their fuel consumption.                                                                  </p>
   </div>

    <h2>Tailgating</h2>
    <div class="Column">
     <div class="Text">
      <p>Tailgating, also known as <em>drafting</em>, is the practice of riding near the rear of
         a large vehicle (lorry, coach etc.) to exploit the slipstream generated by that larger
         vehicle, thus significantly reducing the drag exerted on the trailer.                   </p>   
      <p>Cyclists have been known to engage in this feat too, preferring to trail lorries due to 
         their larger slipstreams and lower acceleration. 
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO7_Fq56g2c" target="_blank">
         Here is an example of a professional 
         cyclist drafting behind a truck in Brazil on a motorway, and achieving 124 km/h as 
         a result.                                                                           </a></p>
      <p>Whilst this method greatly increases mileage, it is highly risky due to collisions from
         sudden deceleration, and is illegal in multiple countries.                              </p>
